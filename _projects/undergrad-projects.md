During my undergraduate studies at the University of Pittsburgh, I completed multiple projects across various fields. These projects included topics such as computational fluid dynamics and mechanical design.

# Axial Velocity Profiles for Developing and Fully Developed Regions
This report provides a detailed analysis of axial velocity profiles and pressure gradients within pipe flows, employing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations in ANSYS. It aims to demonstrate the characteristics of developing and fully developed flow regions in a standardized pipe setup. By emphasizing the transition between these regions, the results provide insights into enhancing the efficiency of fluid transport systems in various engineering applications. This study not only deepens the understanding of fluid dynamics under controlled parameters but also serves as an important resource for designing more effective fluid handling infrastructure.

# Design of Multi-Location Temperature Detector
This project aims to develop a reliable temperature measurement system for use in high-radiation environments, such as nuclear power plants. Sponsored by Westinghouse, the project addresses the limitations of traditional temperature measurement systems, which struggle under intense radiation. The proposed solution uses analog circuits to reduce the vulnerability of electronic components to radiation, ensuring more stable performance. The design iterations included the use of summing amplifiers and Wheatstone Bridge circuits to enhance precision and compactness. The final prototype meets requirements like measuring temperatures between 400-500Â°C and withstanding high humidity and radiation levels. The team's work involved overcoming significant challenges, such as minimizing signal noise and improving accuracy, making it highly relevant for industrial applications.
